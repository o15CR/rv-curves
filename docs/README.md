# Documentation index

Current (TUI + FRED sample mode):

1. `../project.md` — overview and scope
2. `tui.md` — TUI workflow + keybindings
3. `fitting.md` — model fitting and selection
4. `models.md` — Nelson–Siegel family + basis functions

Legacy (pre‑FRED CSV workflow):

- `cli.md`, `csv.md`, `output.md`, `architecture.md`, `testing.md`

These legacy docs are retained for reference but no longer describe the runtime behavior.
